Below we have linked our collection protocols, in google docs and as a pdf. We have also linked google spreadsheets which should be copied for data entry and pdf datasheets if paper entry is easier in the field. Get in touch at [gall.size@utoronto.edu](gall.size@utoronto.edu) if you have any questions. Collected data should be submitted with the form under the submit data header, and samples should be mailed with the prepaid mailing envelope.

#### Project extension protocols

Congruence of gall fly and parasitoid phylogenies. As the gall fly splits into new species, each associated with a different goldenrod species, do the flyâ€™s parasitoids and inquilines also split? 

If interested, participants can further contribute by monitoring emergence phenology for the gall maker and the parasitoids/inquilines from 200 addiitonal galls. These parsitoids and inquilines should then be preserved and sent to Linyi Zhang for morphological and genetic analysis.
