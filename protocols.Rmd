Below we have linked our collection protocols, in google docs and as a pdf. We have also linked google spreadsheets which should be copied for data entry and pdf datasheets if paper entry is easier in the field. Get in touch at [gall.size@utoronto.ca](mailto:gall.size@utoronto.ca) if you have any questions. Collected data should be submitted with the form under the submit data header, and samples should be mailed with the prepaid mailing envelope.

#### Site selection and leaf collection protocol
Below is linked a google doc and a pdf of the protocol for selecting an appropriate site, collecting leaves, and if interested, dissecting out and collecting insects from galls.

Before mailing collected leaf samples and optional insects with the prepaid shipping envelope, please submit this form so we have neccesary information on your samples.

#### Project extension protocols

Congruence of gall fly and parasitoid phylogenies. As the gall fly splits into new species, each associated with a different goldenrod species, do the flyâ€™s parasitoids and inquilines also split? 

If interested, participants can further contribute by monitoring emergence phenology for the gall maker and the parasitoids/inquilines from 200 addiitonal galls. These parsitoids and inquilines should then be preserved and sent to Linyi Zhang for morphological and genetic analysis.
