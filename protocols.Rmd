Below we have linked our collection protocols, in google docs and as a pdf. We have also linked google spreadsheets which should be copied for data entry and pdf datasheets if paper entry is easier in the field. Get in touch at [gall.size@utoronto.ca](mailto:gall.size@utoronto.ca) if you have any questions. Collected data should be submitted with the form under the submit data header, and samples should be mailed with the prepaid mailing envelope.
