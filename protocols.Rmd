Below we have linked our collection protocols, in google docs and as a pdf. We have also linked google spreadsheets which should be copied for data entry and pdf datasheets if paper entry is easier in the field. Get in touch at [gall.size@utoronto.ca](mailto:gall.size@utoronto.ca) if you have any questions. Collected data should be submitted with the form under the submit data header, and samples should be mailed with the prepaid mailing envelope.

### Gall collection, measurement, and dissection protocol
Below is linked the protocol and corresponding datasheets for Spring gall measurement and dissection. Data entry is done in two phases: 1) manual data entry while collecting data using the attached datasheets and 2) entering this data into the excel file linked below. An image of your paper data sheet and the digital file is then submitted to us through the [data submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfk_eUa8WQ4Rp4WxrAdC_IiGDEeJ620sN0zKJxZjZVU0fWHlg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
